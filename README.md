* Bootstrap

## Installation
#

1. Make sure you have mongodb installed on your machine and a database named final-project created.

2. Clone down the back-end portion of the app - https://github.com/jpardike/final-project-server

3. Move into that directory in your terminal and run - npm i - to install any dependencies.

4. Move out of the server directory in your terminal and clone down the front-end portion of the app - https://github.com/jpardike/final-project-client

5. Move into the newly created front-end directory and run - npm i - to install the dependencies for the front-end.

6. Have to terminals open, one in the front-end directory and another in the back-end directory.

7. In the front-end terminal run - npm start - this will run the front-end at localhost:3000 in your browser.

8. In the back-end terminal run - nodemon server.js - this will run the back-end at localhost:4000 in your browser.

9. With both servers now running, the front-end and the back-end are now communicating and you can start coding!

I plan on making this a much more finished product by adding auth, notifications, messaging, a search function and allowing users to make friends, and groups.
